# Welcome to Upgrade Assurance documentation!

Upgrade Assurance documentation includes the set of libraries written in
`Python` to ease the process of writing checks and state snapshots
during PanOS upgrade on the Next Generation Firewall. Both checks and
snapshots can be used to verify the state of a device during an upgrade
process. What\'more, it is possible to generate a report for these
checks.

The libraries were written to support Ansible. They depend on
[Pan-OS-Python](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-python)
libraries and therefore, are quite easy to fit into the [PanOS Ansible
modules collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/paloaltonetworks/panos).

All users may benefit from the documentation including [installation, how-to guides, and background information](/panos-upgrade/docs/), which is now published here on pan.dev.
